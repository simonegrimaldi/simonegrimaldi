## ☁️ Cloud & Data Engineering
Knowledge acquired through an industrial project/thesis on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, with a strong focus on **security**, **privacy**, and **GDPR compliance**.

- **Serverless ETL Pipelines**: Cloud Run / Cloud Functions / Cloud Scheduler → BigQuery  
- **Data Security & Privacy**: Cloud DLP/SDP, deterministic & non-deterministic encryption with **Cloud KMS**  
- **Access Control**: **IAM** with least privilege principle  
- **Data Modeling & Analytics**: denormalized data loaded into **BigQuery** for large-scale analysis  
- **Best Practices**: cloud-native architectures, observability, and operational sustainability  

> Goal: building secure, compliant, and scalable cloud-native solutions for data-driven organizations.
